# Word Salad: Themed Word Link Game

## Premise
Word Salad is a fun and challenging word puzzle game where players are presented with a 4x4 grid of scattered letters. The objective is to form words by linking adjacent letters (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to create valid words that fit a given theme. Themes can include categories such as fruits, animals, TV shows, countries, and more.

## Gameplay
- Each round, a new theme is presented to the player (e.g., "Fruits").
- The 4x4 grid is filled with a random assortment of letters.
- Players must connect adjacent letters to form words that match the theme.
- Words must be at least 4 letters long (can be longer, or consist of multiple-part words like "sawed-off" would be sawedoff without the dash)
- The game does not have a time timit, but a time spent on puzzle is shown on round completion

- After a successful guess, letters, which dont exist in any of the remaining answers, must disappear from the grid.
- The letters don't have to be in a single line, they just have to be adjacent (vertical, horizontal, diagonal)

## Features
- Multiple themes to keep gameplay fresh and challenging.
- Hints and power-ups to assist players when stuck.
- Visually engaging and accessible UI for all ages.
